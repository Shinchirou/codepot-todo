#TODO

Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console (stdout).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

To make a Node.js program, create a new file with a `.js` extension and start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the
`node` command. e.g.:

```sh
$ node program.js
```

You can write to the file in the same way as in the console:

```js
console.log("text")
```
